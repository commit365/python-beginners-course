# Data Analysis with Pandas

## Description

This project is a simple data analysis script built in Python using the Pandas library. It demonstrates how to load a dataset (Iris dataset), perform basic analysis, and display the results. The script provides insights into the dataset, including statistics and species counts.

## Features

- Load the Iris dataset using scikit-learn.
- Display the first few rows of the dataset.
- Provide basic descriptive statistics.
- Count occurrences of each species.
- Calculate the average sepal length by species.

## Installation

To run this analysis script, you need to have Python installed on your machine along with the required libraries. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Required Libraries

You need to install the following libraries:

- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

### Steps to Run the Analysis

1. **Clone the Repository** (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/commit365/python-beginners-course.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd python-beginners-course/projects/data_analysis
   ```

3. **Install Required Libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
   ```

4. **Run the Analysis Script**:
   ```bash
   python analysis.py
   ```

## Usage

When you run the script, it will load the Iris dataset and perform the following analyses:

1. Display the first five rows of the dataset.
2. Show basic statistics for the dataset.
3. Count the number of occurrences of each species in the dataset.
4. Calculate and display the average sepal length for each species.

## Example Output

```
First 5 rows of the dataset:
   sepal length (cm)  sepal width (cm)  petal length (cm)  petal width (cm)      species

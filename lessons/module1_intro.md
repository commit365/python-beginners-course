## Activities

### 1. Installation Guide and Environment Setup

**Instructions:**

1. **Download Python:**
   - Visit the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version for your operating system.

2. **Install Python:**
   - Follow the installation prompts. Ensure you check the option to add Python to your PATH during installation.

3. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open your command line interface (Command Prompt, Terminal) and run:
     ```bash
     python --version
     ```
   - You should see the installed Python version.

4. **Install Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Open your command line interface and run:
     ```bash
     pip install notebook
     ```

5. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   - In your command line, navigate to your desired directory and run:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - This will open Jupyter in your web browser.

6. **Install VSCode (Optional):**
   - Visit the [VSCode website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download the installer.
   - Follow the installation instructions and install the Python extension for VSCode.

7. **Install PyCharm (Optional):**
   - Visit the [PyCharm website](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/) and download the Community Edition.
   - Follow the installation instructions.

### 2. First Program: "Hello, World!"

**Instructions:**

1. **Open Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Create a new notebook by clicking on "New" and selecting "Python 3".

2. **Write Your First Program:**
   - In the first cell, type the following code:
     ```python
     print("Hello, World!")
     ```

3. **Run the Cell:**
   - Press `Shift + Enter` to execute the cell. You should see the output:
     ```
     Hello, World!
     ```

4. **Using an IDE (Optional):**
   - If using VSCode or PyCharm, create a new Python file (e.g., `hello_world.py`) and add the same code:
     ```python
     print("Hello, World!")
     ```
   - Run the script using the IDE's run button or terminal.

## Conclusion

In this module, you have learned about the Python programming language, set up your development environment, and executed your first Python program. You are now ready to move on to the next module, where you will explore basic syntax and data types in Python.

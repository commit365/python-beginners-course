## Activities

### 1. Develop a Final Project of Choice

**Instructions:**

1. **Choose Your Project:**
   - Select a project that interests you and aligns with the skills you have learned. Some project ideas include:
     - **Web Scraper**: Create a script that collects data from a website.
     - **Simple Game**: Develop a text-based or graphical game.
     - **Data Analysis**: Analyze a dataset using Pandas and visualize the results.
     - **Contact Book**: Expand upon the contact book project from Module 6.

2. **Project Planning:**
   - Outline the objectives of your project.
   - Break down the project into smaller tasks and set deadlines for each task.
   - Consider the libraries and tools you will need to complete your project.

3. **Development:**
   - Start coding your project, implementing the features you planned.
   - Regularly test your code to ensure it works as expected.

### 2. Present the Project on GitHub

**Instructions:**

1. **Create a GitHub Repository:**
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and create a new repository for your project.
   - Name your repository appropriately (e.g., `my_final_project`).

2. **Initialize Git in Your Project Directory:**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory.
   - Run the following commands:
     ```bash
     git init
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     ```

3. **Push Your Project to GitHub:**
   - Link your local repository to the GitHub repository:
     ```bash
     git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/my_final_project.git
     git push -u origin master
     ```

4. **Documentation:**
   - Create a `README.md` file in your project directory with the following sections:
     - **Project Title**: A brief title for your project.
     - **Description**: A summary of what your project does.
     - **Installation Instructions**: How to set up and run your project.
     - **Usage**: Examples of how to use your project.
     - **Contributing**: Guidelines for others who want to contribute.
     - **License**: Information about the project's license.

   Example `README.md` structure:
   ```markdown
   # My Final Project

   ## Description

   ```

5. **Presentation:**
   - Prepare a short presentation (5-10 minutes) to showcase your project. Include:
     - An overview of the project and its objectives.
     - A demonstration of the main features.
     - Challenges you faced and how you overcame them.
     - Future improvements or features you would like to add.

## Conclusion
